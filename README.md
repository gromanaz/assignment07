# Assignment 07 - Legibility, Readability, and Typography

## Original Website
This assignment is based on: http://lkoblenc.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/index.html

The original fonts used in the website are mostly based on the font stack Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif. There is one exception where there is only the browser default font.

## New Fonts
* Annie Use Your Telescope - headings
* Open Sans - paragraphs

I chose a combination of two contrasting fonts for this website about Nairobi. The font Annie Use Your Telescope is a hand-written font and in my opinion it fits very well with the theme of tourism that is often very personal and also described in the website. Moreover, this font is unusual and we are not used to seeing it on website, just like visiting Nairobi is somewhat exotic for most people too. As content-driven website a font like Annie Use Your Telescope breaks up monotone paragraphs nicely.
Complimentary to Annie Use Your Telescope, I chose the font Open Sans which is a humanist sans serif typeface and provides a good contrast to the individuality of Annie Use Your Telescope. The intend is the combination with a more clear typeface that is still not too impersonal or clinical. As this website is designed to inform about Nairobi, the main font should be one that is easy to read, like Open Sans, and be a neutral compliment to thee distinctive highlighting font Annie Use Your Telescope.
I plan to use Annie Use Your Telescope for headers, headings, anything that is emphasized, but short, otherwise the reading experience would probably not be enjoyable anymore. Open Sans is the font I chose for paragraphs and lengthy text because it is not ornamented and the reader can focus better on the content.

## Edits
Based on the article: 10 Principles Of Readability And Web Typography

* more user-friendly headers:
  * The original headers had up to three different colors, which was very challenging to look at and also to read. The reduction to only one color at a time improves the readability and the contrast to the background. In this effort, I also decided to not use shadows for the font.
  * I increased the font-size to improve readability, but also to help the reader distinguish better between headings and text, as they were very similar in terms of size.
  * I split up the header into two lines because it provides for a better rhythm in reading.
  * I changed the font to Annie Use Your Telescope, which is unique but still legible.

* scannable text:
  * As mentioned above for headers, I reduced the colors to one only, which might not look as cool, but definitely makes it easier to read and easier to scan.
  * The font size should not too big, but also not too small. I used the size of the header as orientation to provide enough contrast for scanning.
  * Increasing the line height also helped with readability, as before the next was very close and difficult to focus on.
  * An eye-friendlier text color, helps to provide a relaxing reading experience.
  * The font I chose helps clean scanning as it doesn't have any serifs.

* consistency:
  * To help the reader recognizing similar elements across the page, I designed all links in same style: one color for one page and same text decoration.
  * For better orienation, I kept header in the same place instead of changing it.
  * This is similar to the repetition principle in CRAP.

* whitespace:
  * I included enough space between text and pictures because it is a content-driven website and helps the reader to separate individual sections.
  * For this reason, I also added more distance to the end of the viewport.

* density of text:
  * see scannable text for font size + line height
  * According to the alignment principle, I decided against justifying the content to provide only one straight edge as a specific reading guidance.

* emphasis of important elements:
  * The most important elements were the header and headings, so to make them stand out, I increased the difference in font-size to the main text which also improves readability.

* organization of information:
  * I reorganized the layout from three columns to one with only one block to help the reader focus on one element at a time which is similar to the F-pattern where the user can keep scanning the headings until they find one of interest.

* clean graphical implementation:
  * I added more space around images because previously they were touching the content.

* use of separators
  * I added lines to separate the individual articles on the about page and keep the spirit of individual sections of the original page.

* good margins:
  * I increased the margins to offset sections, help with readability and concentrate the focus on one particular area in the viewport.
