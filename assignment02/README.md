# Assignment 07 - Legibility, Readability, and Typography

## Original Website
This assignment is based on: http://lkoblenc.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/index.html

The original fonts used in the website are mostly based on the font stack Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif. There is an exception where there is only the browser default font.

## New Fonts
* Annie Use Your Telescope - headings
* Open Sans - paragraphs

I chose a combination of two contrasting fonts for this website about Nairobi. The font Annie Use Your Telescope is a hand-written font and in my opinion it fits very well with the theme of tourism that is often very personal and also described in the website. Moreover, this font is unusual and we are not used to seeing it on website, just like visiting Nairobi is somewhat exotic for most people too. Complimentary to Annie Use Your Telescope, I chose the font Open Sans which is a humanist sans serif typeface and provides a good contrast to the individuality of Annie Use Your Telescope. The intend is the combination with a more clear typeface that is still not too impersonal or clinical while providing a relaxing and easy reading experience.
